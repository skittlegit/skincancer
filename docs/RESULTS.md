# Results

All results use the full Fitzpatrick17k set (D21). Numbers are the mean over seeds 0, 1 and 2, with group-bootstrap 95% CIs (D8). "op90" rates use the threshold that catches 90% of cancers on each seed's source val, applied unchanged to every set (D17). Full tables are in `results/<exp>/metrics.csv`.

## E1 / E2: source-only baseline, EfficientNet-B0

| Test set | AUC [95% CI] | Missed cancers (op90) | n |

| Source test, FST I–III | macro 0.893 [0.87, 0.92]; binary 0.903 | — | 435 |
| Fitzpatrick17k IV–VI (target test) | macro 0.888 [0.84, 0.94] | — | 86 |

**Reading:**
- With the full training set, in-domain performance rises: source test 0.89, and target test 0.89 with no gap between light and dark skin within the same atlases.
- At other institutions the model is no better: DDI V–VI is still at chance (0.53, CI includes 0.5), and DDI I–II (0.65) and MIDAS (0.69) are slightly below what the partial-download development run showed. More atlas data makes the model better at the atlases, not at other clinics.
- False alarms on Indian clinic images are high: almost half of DermaCon-IN's non-cancer images are called malignant.
